IDEAS

<!-- - Using a Class object to store API information under variables named like user-1, user-2 etc -->
Overkill

- Using for loop to store each information and to generate 12 divs
Might wanna think on using object methods for that and see if it works

- Specifying we only want small image and making a new API request for medium size image
